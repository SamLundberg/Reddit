Determining a Reddit by identifying words

Reddit is one of the most popular Social Media sites today.  Anyone can browse, read, post, upload videos or pictures, related to any subject they are interested in.  But what if we can teach a machine to identify words in thread titles to determine what subreddit it belongs to, if we were comparing two subreddits? In this project I am going to compare the subreddits of Star Wars and Star Trek.  Two different worlds, but still similar in many ways.  Can words be used to predict if a thread belongs to the Star Wars subreddit? That is what I want to answer
